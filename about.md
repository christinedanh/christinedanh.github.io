I’m Christine Danh, a Los Angeles-based designer with a background in behavioral science. I like people, learning about people, and creating valuable solutions for people.

I’m driven by my passion in cultivating an inclusive, caring community. This drive has motivated every one of my career decisions thus far and I am continuously looking to continue that passion in every role I take on.

For six years, I worked in a clinical setting as a behavioral therapist and behavior analyst for children with developmental disabilities. Though I whole-heartedly enjoyed and took pride in the one-on-one impact I was making in a clinical setting, I discovered that with design, it’s possible to create impact at a grander scale while being able to nurture my own joy for artistic creativity and passion for behavioral science.

Currently, I’m designing for small businesses and start ups.

Offline, you can find me exploring beautiful mother nature with my dear husband and our puppy, Zorro. If not outdoors, I’m likely deep in a book or creating unexpected coffee, tea or cocktail concoctions.
