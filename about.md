I’m Christine Danh, a Los Angeles-based designer with a background in behavioral science. I like people, learning about people, and creating valuable solutions for people.

I’m driven by my passion in cultivating an inclusive, caring community. This drive has motivated every one of my career decisions thus far and I am continuously looking to continue that passion in every role I take on.

For six years, I worked in a clinical setting where I wore many hats from therapist to behavioral consultant to behavior analyst. Though I whole-heartedly enjoyed and took pride in the one-on-one impact I was making in a clinical setting, I discovered that with UX Design, it’s possible to create impact at a grander scale while being able to nurture my own joy for artistic creativity and passion for behavioral science.

Currently, I’m designing for people with disabilities at startup. I’ve teamed up with a team of researchers and designers to create a product to connect people with disabilities with the help they need.

Offline, you can find me exploring beautiful mother nature with my dear husband and our puppy, Zorro. If not outdoors, I’m likely deep in a book or creating unexpected coffee, tea or cocktail concoctions.
