I’m a UI/UX Designer and Developer– I enjoy solving complex problems, creating impactful and user-centered experiences across multiple platforms that are informed by research and data. I am currently a Product Designer at Pond5. I previously was a Senior Developer/Experience Designer at Responsify and an UI/UX Designer at Makr.

I’m passionate about design technology and tools, including developing Figma component libraries and design systems to improve the design process and deliver consistent experiences to users.

I founded FOCA Stock in 2013, a free and curated creative asset library. FOCA provides free photos, videos, and templates for commercial use. It has had 1,882,250 sessions and has been featured on Shopify and Canva.

When I’m not designing, you’ll find me taking photos and exploring the outdoors. I’m also interested in urban mobility, transit, and the future of cities.
